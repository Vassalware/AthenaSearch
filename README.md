# AthenaSearch

A Spotlight Search-like application launcher for Windows.

![Demo Gif](https://github.com/Vassalware/AthenaSearch/blob/master/Art/demo.gif "Example Usage")

This was made as a replacement for the Windows start menu as an application launcher, with possible results being selected from a json file rather than the entire computer. The search functionality and interface was somewhat modeled after [Vivaldi's](https://vivaldi.com/) Quick Commands.
